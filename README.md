### Persistent MySQL Storage

By default, whenever you bring down the Docker network, your MySQL data will be removed after the containers are destroyed. If you would like to have persistent data that remains after bringing containers down and back up, do the following:

1. Create a `mysql` folder in the project root, alongside the `nginx` and `src` folders.
2. Under the mysql service in your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following lines:

```
volumes:
  - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```
